MapCompassCamera
================

An "augmented reality" attempt, mashing up the iPad Camera with a Map and using the compass/GPS to force the map to lock to your position.

===============
Prereq's:
[ArcGIS iOS SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/ios/info/install.htm)

### Getting Started

Ideally you have your own map service to add, if not checkout [ArcGIS.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and search around for a service to try out.

Open the 'MapCompassCameraViewController.m' and look for the 'NSURL *netmapUrl = [NSURL URLWithString:@""];' and add your own resource URL.
